# Status Report

**Prepared by:** Codex (GPT-5)

## Overall Status
- ✅ Documentation refresh complete.
- ⚠️ Technical debt remains in data ingestion error handling and export automation.
- ⏳ Test automation is still pending.

## Highlights
- Added 16 documentation artifacts covering strategy, architecture, onboarding, usage, maintenance, and delivery confirmation.
- Captured dependency list in `requirements.txt` to stabilize environment parity.
- Identified key refactoring priorities in `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md`.

## Risks
- Lack of automated regression tests means future refactors rely on manual QA.
- Ansys integration depends on external software availability; failures are surfaced only at runtime.
- Large datasets could impact responsiveness; caching and async loading are not yet implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Review and socialize the new documentation package with engineering and test teams.
2. Prioritize low-effort refactors (see `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md`) to improve stability.
3. Define a testing strategy (sample datasets, CI configuration) to reduce manual verification overhead.

## Blockers
- None identified for documentation; further improvements depend on available development bandwidth and access to representative datasets.
