# Executive Summary (Mechanical Engineering)

WE MechLoad Viewer was built around the daily workflow of drivetrain and structural analysts:

- **Rapid Load Validation**: Import raw `.pld` exports directly from the test bench, validate completeness, and spot-check interface loads before results leave the lab.
- **Frequency vs Time Domain Support**: Inspect harmonic content (magnitude and phase) or time histories with equal ease. Time-domain tooling includes windowing, low-pass filtering, and Î”t / sampling-rate diagnostics to confirm data fidelity.
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: Overlay new runs versus baselines, quantify absolute and percent deltas, and isolate side-specific differences across T1/T2/T3 and R1/R2/R3 components.
- **Simulation-Ready Outputs**: Generate CSV extracts for ad hoc analysis and automatically populate Ansys Mechanical harmonic or transient templates, complete with remote points and load schedules.

Mechanical engineers can now close the loop from instrumentation to simulation without writing custom scripts, reducing turnaround time on correlation studies and regression checks.
