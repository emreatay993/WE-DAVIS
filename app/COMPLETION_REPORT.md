# Completion Report

## Scope Delivered
- Authored a complete documentation suite for the `app` package:
  - Strategic overviews (`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_MECHANICAL_ENGINEERING.md`).
  - Technical references (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FILE_INDEX.md`, `SIGNAL_SLOT_REFERENCE.md`).
  - Operational guides (`DETAILED_USER_MANUAL.md`, `START_HERE.md`, `README.md`).
  - Status and delivery artifacts (`DELIVERY_MANIFEST.md`, `FINAL_DELIVERY_*`, `STATUS_REPORT.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`, `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md`).
- Captured project dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## Not In Scope
- No application source code was modified.
- No automated tests were added or executed (manual testing remains the current practice).

## Risks & Follow-Ups
- Documentation assumes familiarity with `.pld` data exports; consider adding sample datasets or schema references in a future iteration.
- Ansys export instructions rely on local installations; adding validation scripts or diagnostics would reduce support load.

The documentation set is ready for distribution and should serve as the baseline for onboarding, maintenance, and stakeholder alignment.
