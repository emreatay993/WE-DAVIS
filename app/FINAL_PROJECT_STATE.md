# Final Project State

## Codebase
- Source files remain unchanged; functionality is identical to the pre-documentation snapshot.
- The application continues to depend on manual testing workflows for validation.
- Key modules (`data_manager`, `controllers`, `analysis`, `plotting`, `ui`) are documented at the architectural and operational levels.

## Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation package delivered (see `DELIVERY_MANIFEST.md`).
- Dependencies captured in `requirements.txt`, enabling consistent environment setup.
- Risks, refactoring opportunities, and status tracking are now recorded for future iterations.

## Outstanding Items
- Implement graceful handling when users cancel the initial data-folder prompt.
- Add automated regression tests for data ingestion and plotting pipelines.
- Evaluate performance optimizations for large datasets (caching, async loading).

The repository is ready for handoff or continued development with clear guidance for all roles involved.
