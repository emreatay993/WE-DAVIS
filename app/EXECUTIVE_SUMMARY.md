# Executive Summary

WE MechLoad Viewer centralizes inspection of mechanical load datasets produced during drivetrain testing. The application streamlines three business-critical workflows:
- **Insight Generation**: Engineers can load one or many `.pld` runs, interrogate individual channels, evaluate part loads, and overlay comparison data without scripting.
- **Decision Support**: Interactive plots (single-channel, interface, and comparison views) reveal load distribution, symmetry, and anomalies, accelerating review cycles.
- **Downstream Handoff**: Built-in exports deliver curated CSVs and ready-to-run Ansys Mechanical templates, closing the loop between test and simulation teams.

The codebase is structured around a PyQt5 UI with Plotly-powered visualizations and reusable pandas/numpy data services. Documentation delivered in this update covers architecture, onboarding, detailed usage, signal mapping, and maintenance guidance. Together these resources reduce ramp-up time for new developers and clarify the operational boundaries for stakeholders planning future enhancements.
