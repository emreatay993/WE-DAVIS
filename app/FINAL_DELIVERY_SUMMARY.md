# Final Delivery Summary

## Deliverables
- 16 documentation files covering executive context, architecture, onboarding, user operations, maintenance planning, and delivery sign-off.
- `requirements.txt` enumerating runtime dependencies for the `app` package.

## Quality Checks
- Cross-links between documents verified (e.g., README references FILE_INDEX, Architecture).
- Documentation aligns with the current code structure after manual inspection of controllers, UI tabs, analysis helpers, and exporters.
- No code changes were introduced; application behavior remains stable.

## Recommendations
- Share the package with engineering, test, and leadership teams to ensure alignment.
- Revisit documentation after the next functional release or refactor to keep guidance current.
